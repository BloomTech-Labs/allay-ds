## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/wDXK4crl/allay23)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Allay-eb3c5b88ffab4ff199663cb40fcc1402)

[Deployed Project](https://labs21-allay-fe.herokuapp.com/)

[Deployed DS API](https://allay23-staging-ds.herokuapp.com/)

### Tech Stack

We use Python in Jupyter Notebooks to explore and model the data. We then save
that model and implement it within a FastAPI app, which is deployed to Heroku
for live deployment and prediction.

### Predictions

We use a text classifier model to categorize whether reviews posted to the
Allay website are appropriate.

### Explanatory Variables

Ultimately, the explanatory variable is the text that is posted to the website.
This gets broken down into numerical features which are then modeled.
